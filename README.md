Note-taking app:

	• Develop a note-taking app where users can create, edit and delete notes. 
	• Serialize notes into JSON format for storage.
	• Give an easy and/or an automatic way to store notes. The user should be able to change the content of the notes. 
	• Upon page reload, retrieve all notes from localStorage and display them. 
	• Include the option to delete notes. 
	• Style the page. Make sure that the page scales reasonably well when resizing the browser window. 
	• Use basic error handling to make sure that everything works without errors, even with bad user input. 
	• You can add extra functionality such as undo or anything you think could be useful or interesting.
Additional features:
	
 	• Make a folder(filter, that combines notes under name/key)
  	• Save, retrieve all notes and "folders" in/from DB (Mongo DB, because it is document based DB). 
   	** I need a server side for that: when page is closed and the session is over, user can retrieve saved notes from DB and do stuff with them.
   	• Add actual description to the note (as notes in typicall mobile app)
    ** Add button to create an "object"(description), where description is connected to note by "title"/note's name, that user made before.
